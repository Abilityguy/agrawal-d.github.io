            <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading novels. My favourite genre is Fantasy. In the past, I’ve enjoyed reading
                the
                Inheritance Cycle (Eragon), A Song of Ice and Fire, Narnia, and other fantasy series. I also enjoyed
                reading One
                Flew over the Cuckoos’ Nest recently.</p>

            <p>A few days ago, I finished reading a bizarre book - One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García
                Márquez. It
                took me more than three months to finish reading the book, as I read it in occasional bursts. It is the
                strangest book I’ve ever read. Its genre is called ‘Magical Realism.’ The book is odd because, in the
                story, the
                reality intertwines with magical events happening every day. These magical events are not strange to the
                characters of the book - they are an ordinary occurrence.</p>

            <p>“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant
                afternoon
                when his father took him to discover ice.” - this magical and beautiful quote is the first line of the
                book.</p>

            <p>The book chronicles the story of the Buendía family over 100 years and several generations. It begins
                with the
                founding of the town of Macondo and how the family created a settlement nowhere. One of the strange
                things about
                the book is that most characters have the same name and live for hundreds of years, so it becomes
                difficult to
                keep track of who is who. The book covers many phases of the Buendia family - how initially they were
                curious
                and interacted with gipsies to find magical things. And how slowly the town grew and evolved, attracting
                outsiders. It is filled with several magical romances, sometimes between the family members. Certain
                magical
                events take place in the book, like when the characters discover ice, or travel over the town in magic
                carpets,
                of they purchase magical inventions from gipsies or how they spend days trying to make gold in
                laboratories.
                Then comes the phase of the downfall of the family, when outsiders slowly arrive and take over the town,
                how
                they become colonized and almost enslaved and lose their founding values. The prose is rich, imaginative
                and
                magical. It is precisely the type of books I like to read - full of magic and surrealism.</p>

            <p>I found the book in the Nobel prize website - it won the prize for Literature. I really enjoyed it and
                hope to
                find other exciting titles in the Nobel cache.</p>
