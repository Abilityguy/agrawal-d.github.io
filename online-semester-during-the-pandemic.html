            <p>Like all universities around the world, mine’s conducting the semester online too. And sadly, it has not
                been a
                great experience. While the professors have tried their best to adapt to the circumstances, I feel I
                have not
                been able to learn as much as would have been
                possible on campus. There are many reasons for this, and I will try to explain each of them.</p>

            <p>My college decided to conduct the semester entirely online - including all classes, labs and
                examinations.
                Classes are conducted
                via Google Meet, and course content is hosted on a Moodle CMS server. Tests are conducted on it too, but
                that
                was a disaster, as I
                will explain soon. While I have been lucky as a Computer Science student because CS labs can be
                conducted online
                with ease, I am
                concerned about my friends from other disciplines - such as Chemical Engineering or Electrical
                Engineering,
                because their labs
                can not be conducted online.</p>

            <p><img src="/img/pandemic.png" alt="Pandemic Illustration"></p>

            <p>I appreciate the efforts of my teachers in doing their best to teach us in this unprecedented situation,
                and this
                blog post in
                no way undermines their teaching skills. I merely highlight how things are not perfect and can perhaps
                be
                improved.</p>

            <h2 id="online-lectures">Online lectures</h2>

            <p>As I mentioned earlier, lectures are conducted via Google Meet. While it is a decent platform, I was
                initially
                very disappointed in the
                way college faculty had been using the platform. Firstly, most teachers read off from pre-prepared
                slides and
                for an
                hour. Students are expected to remain “muted” and only interact with the teacher via chats. Some
                teachers
                instead assign a “representative” who speaks for everyone else. This blew my mind because others were
                utterly
                dependent on this representative to
                be able to convey their doubts to the teacher. Also, we are expected to write our doubts on chat, and
                the
                representative would then
                read our question to the instructor, who would then answer it. Further irritation comes from the fact
                that
                teachers usually teach with
                Microsoft PowerPoint in editing mode. More than 50% of the screen is filled with cluttered UI and
                useless tabs
                and ribbons. Using the
                full-screen mode would be much better and reduce cognitive load.</p>

            <p>However, things have been improving a lot. Many teachers have been using touch-tablets/ other devices to
                teach
                interactively on
                whiteboard apps instead of relying solely on slide decks, and the lectures have been made more
                interactive. This
                has been a significant
                improvement!</p>

            <h2 id="tests-and-evaluations">Tests and Evaluations</h2>

            <p>Before going into detail on how tests are conducted, I would like to vent my frustration on the number of
                evaluative components for
                each course. Most courses have at least 6 evaluative components, including quizzes, tests, assignments
                and a
                comprehensive examination.
                This has been overwhelming for most students when the increased screen time has already been placing a
                lot of
                strain on us.</p>

            <p>Coming back to tests and evaluations - they were initially conducted on a self-hosted Moodle CMS server,
                but that
                turned out to be
                a disaster. When hundreds of students tried to take a test on the single Moodle instance, the server was
                unable
                to cope up with the load
                and kept crashing. This was terrifying for most students as we were concerned about our responses having
                been
                saved when the server
                crashed. Now, tests are conducted via Google Classroom using forms. This has turned out to be much more
                reliable, although it’s still
                not a perfect solution, as it is straightforward to press the back button and lose all your progress
                accidentally - there is no autosave /
                auto-submit feature in Google Forms.</p>

            <h2 id="campus-life">Campus Life</h2>

            <p>I sorely miss being on campus with my friends. A campus environment is very conducive to discussions and
                innovation. Being cramped up
                in front of a laptop all day attending virtual lectures alone is no fun at all. Neither are group
                projects and
                other virtual activities.
                I hope that this pandemic resolves soon so that I can go back to college. Chilling out and having fun
                with my
                friends was
                the most significant part of my college life and staying at home all day during the pandemic sucks!</p>

            <h2 id="summer-internships">Summer Internships</h2>

            <p>As a 3rd year undergraduate student, I was anxious about not being able to grab a summer internship due
                to a
                recruitment pause
                because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, all the students were fortunate as the internship drive was
                not
                affected, and several
                companies participated in the internship drive, and I managed to bag a fantastic internship. It was
                still a very
                stressful period for me
                as I had to prepare for these internships while keeping up with the increased evaluations.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>The pandemic has been no fun for anyone - be it students, workers or families. I hope that this situation
                goes
                back to normal soon and we can all go back to our everyday lives.</p>
