In my free time, I enjoy reading novels. My favourite genre is Fantasy. In the past, I've enjoyed reading the Inheritance Cycle (Eragon), A Song of Ice and Fire, Narnia, and other fantasy series. I also enjoyed reading One Flew over the Cuckoos' Nest recently.

A few days ago, I finished reading a bizarre book - One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. It took me more than three months to finish reading the book, as I read it in occasional bursts. It is the strangest book I've ever read. Its genre is called 'Magical Realism.' The book is odd because, in the story, the reality intertwines with magical events happening every day. These magical events are not strange to the characters of the book - they are an ordinary occurrence.

"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice." - this magical and beautiful quote is the first line of the book.

The book chronicles the story of the Buendía family over 100 years and several generations. It begins with the founding of the town of Macondo and how the family created a settlement nowhere. One of the strange things about the book is that most characters have the same name and live for hundreds of years, so it becomes difficult to keep track of who is who. The book covers many phases of the Buendia family - how initially they were curious and interacted with gipsies to find magical things. And how slowly the town grew and evolved, attracting outsiders. It is filled with several magical romances, sometimes between the family members. Certain magical events take place in the book, like when the characters discover ice, or travel over the town in magic carpets, of they purchase magical inventions from gipsies or how they spend days trying to make gold in laboratories. Then comes the phase of the downfall of the family, when outsiders slowly arrive and take over the town, how they become colonized and almost enslaved and lose their founding values. The prose is rich, imaginative and magical. It is precisely the type of books I like to read - full of magic and surrealism.

I found the book in the Nobel prize website - it won the prize for Literature. I really enjoyed it and hope to find other exciting titles in the Nobel cache.
