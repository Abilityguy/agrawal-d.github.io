Summer internships are a great way to be productive during the summer breaks and advance your career, while also making some pocket money! This year, I prepared
hard to bag an internship, and finally did manage to land an internship, but only after getting rejected several times. To make
it easier for other students who want to land an internship, I explain how on can go about preparing for the online coding tests, interviews and more!

## What all you need to prepare

Most tech companies require the following:

- **Familiarity with at least one standard programming language**, Such as C++/ C/ Java/ C/ Python. I recommend being familiar with at least two, because sometimes your favourite language may not be allowed, or sometimes you may be asked to code in a different language for each question ( happened with me for a HackerRank test ). You should be able to implement data structures and algorithms in the language of your choice.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms** are the bread and butter of online coding challenges and most technical interviews. Be sure to be very strong in this area. I will share below how you can do that. Note: If you are a computer science student, you may have a data structures course as a part of your curriculum.
  That is not enough for internship prep., and you will need to prepare separately still.

- **Object-oriented programming** is also fundamental. Some companies focus solely on this during interviews. You should be able to both recall theoretical concepts as well as write code in an object-oriented language. Java is perfect for this!

- **Database Systems** are also somewhat important, and this depends on the company you are applying to. You may be asked to explain concepts like Normalization,
  ACID properties or you may be asked to write SQL queries.

- **Solving puzzles**: These days, very few companies ask you to solve puzzles, so this is not very important to prepare. But try to find out before the interview
  if a particular company is known for asking puzzles and prepare accordingly.

There are other topics, such as Operating Systems and System Design, but you will most likely not be asked these topics as a 3rd-year undergraduate student.

## How to prepare

There are a lot of resources on the internet, and it can be not very clear to choose one to focus on. Here are some sources that are popular in my college!

### Data Structures and Algorithms

This is the most important topic, and you should spend around 80% of your prep time focussing on this. [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) is one
of the best ways to get stronger in DSA and solve problems. It has a topic-wise grouping of questions
and questions are arranged according to difficulty. Each topic also has several tutorials and solved examples.

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is also an excellent place to practice solving questions in a time-constrained environment. While it is a website dedicated to competitive
programming, participating in contests will give you valuable practice for actual interview online rounds.

[GeeksForGeeks](geeksforgeeks.org/) is one of the best sources for looking up algorithm implementations or problem solutions. It has a huge bank of solved problems, and the
explanations are also pretty good! I recommend going through their [must do section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/) towards the end of your preparation.

For additional practice, you can solve random questions on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com).

### Object Oriented Programming

You do not need to prepare much for this. If you have this as a college course, that should be more than enough. If not, you can look at [JavaTPoint OOP Concepts](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts) and [Top 50 OOP Interview Questions](https://career.guru99.com/top-50-oops-interview-questions/). Make sure you remember the four pillars of
OOP, some examples, and have some coding practice in an OOP language like Java/C++. You should be very familiar with the following:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Database Systems

Again, you don't need to worry too much about this. Knowing the basics and being familiar with some essential theoretical concepts is enough. You should also be able to
write SQL queries, including joins, sub-queries, indexing, modification etc.

One great resource for learning SQL is the [W3Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
as it has an interactive SQL system which allows you to run SQL in your browser, without the internet, using WebSQL. For learning theoretical concepts, you should refer to the
syllabus of your college's DBMS course or go through a MOOC. You should also take a look at [these popular questions](https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-interview-questions).

### Puzzles

You should only prepare these if the company you are applying to is known to ask these. Google some standard puzzles like "\<company name\> interview puzzles" and you
should be good to go!

## How much to prepare

Ideally, it would be best if you started preparing about 4-5 months before the interviews start. Focus the most on DSA - practice regularly on InterviewBit/LeetCode and try to give at least
one Codeforces contest in a week. It would help if you started with easy problems - don't jump right away with difficult problems. For Codeforces, you should solve Div 2 A and B in the
beginning and by the end of your preparation, should be able to solve Div 2 A, B, C during a contest. Solving D is even better ( but not strictly necessary)!

With InterviewBit, solve at least one problem from each bucket of a topic, and later when you are done with all, you can solve more problems. Make sure to try for sometime
before looking at hints and solutions. Trying and failing is very important. That is how you will learn.

## Some final remarks

- Don't spend all your time with interview prep - enjoy your college life and try working on some exciting projects. This will also give you valuable experience that you
  can showcase in your resume.

- Remember to also prepare for behavioural questions that are asked in interviews like "Tell me about yourself" or "What are your strengths". Just Google some popular questions and learn how to answer them. There is no need to memorize answers to these questions - you must answer them naturally.

- It is crucial to look at previously asked questions for a particular company as companies have a _very high_ tendency to repeat questions. One of the best
  places to look this up is [GeeksForGeeks interview experiences](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-interview-corner/).

- Prepare for the specific company before an interview. Look at past questions, the company culture and maybe even go through the company's website for some basic info. Your
  interviewer may ask you some questions like "Why do you want to work with us" and this information will help answer such questions.

That's all! Good luck and remember - despite preparing hard, you may still not be able to land an internship. This does not mean you aren't good enough. A lot of people apply, and
getting selected depends a lot on your luck during the interview. Just keep working on your skills, and you will eventually get your dream internship!
