Like all universities around the world, mine's conducting the semester online too. And sadly, it has not been a great experience. While the professors have tried their best to adapt to the circumstances, I feel I have not been able to learn as much as would have been
possible on campus. There are many reasons for this, and I will try to explain each of them.

My college decided to conduct the semester entirely online - including all classes, labs and examinations. Classes are conducted
via Google Meet, and course content is hosted on a Moodle CMS server. Tests are conducted on it too, but that was a disaster, as I
will explain soon. While I have been lucky as a Computer Science student because CS labs can be conducted online with ease, I am
concerned about my friends from other disciplines - such as Chemical Engineering or Electrical Engineering, because their labs
can not be conducted online.

I appreciate the efforts of my teachers in doing their best to teach us in this unprecedented situation, and this blog post in
no way undermines their teaching skills. I merely highlight how things are not perfect and can perhaps be improved.

## Online lectures

As I mentioned earlier, lectures are conducted via Google Meet. While it is a decent platform, I was initially very disappointed in the
way college faculty had been using the platform. Firstly, most teachers read off from pre-prepared slides and for an
hour. Students are expected to remain "muted" and only interact with the teacher via chats. Some teachers instead assign a "representative" who speaks for everyone else. This blew my mind because others were utterly dependent on this representative to
be able to convey their doubts to the teacher. Also, we are expected to write our doubts on chat, and the representative would then
read our question to the instructor, who would then answer it. Further irritation comes from the fact that teachers usually teach with
Microsoft PowerPoint in editing mode. More than 50% of the screen is filled with cluttered UI and useless tabs and ribbons. Using the
full-screen mode would be much better and reduce cognitive load.

However, things have been improving a lot. Many teachers have been using touch-tablets/ other devices to teach interactively on
whiteboard apps instead of relying solely on slide decks, and the lectures have been made more interactive. This has been a significant
improvement!

## Tests and Evaluations

Before going into detail on how tests are conducted, I would like to vent my frustration on the number of evaluative components for
each course. Most courses have at least 6 evaluative components, including quizzes, tests, assignments and a comprehensive examination.
This has been overwhelming for most students when the increased screen time has already been placing a lot of strain on us.

Coming back to tests and evaluations - they were initially conducted on a self-hosted Moodle CMS server, but that turned out to be
a disaster. When hundreds of students tried to take a test on the single Moodle instance, the server was unable to cope up with the load
and kept crashing. This was terrifying for most students as we were concerned about our responses having been saved when the server
crashed. Now, tests are conducted via Google Classroom using forms. This has turned out to be much more reliable, although it's still
not a perfect solution, as it is straightforward to press the back button and lose all your progress accidentally - there is no autosave /
auto-submit feature in Google Forms.

## Campus Life

I sorely miss being on campus with my friends. A campus environment is very conducive to discussions and innovation. Being cramped up
in front of a laptop all day attending virtual lectures alone is no fun at all. Neither are group projects and other virtual activities.
I hope that this pandemic resolves soon so that I can go back to college. Chilling out and having fun with my friends was
the most significant part of my college life and staying at home all day during the pandemic sucks!

## Summer Internships

As a 3rd year undergraduate student, I was anxious about not being able to grab a summer internship due to a recruitment pause
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, all the students were fortunate as the internship drive was not affected, and several
companies participated in the internship drive, and I managed to bag a fantastic internship. It was still a very stressful period for me
as I had to prepare for these internships while keeping up with the increased evaluations.

## Conclusion

The pandemic has been no fun for anyone - be it students, workers or families. I hope that this situation goes back to normal soon and we can all go back to our everyday lives.
