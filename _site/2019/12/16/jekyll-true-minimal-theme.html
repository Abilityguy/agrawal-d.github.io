<div class="content">
  <p>A long time ago, I stumbled upon a beautiful and simple website - the personal blog / website of <a href="https://guzey.com/">Alexy Guzey</a>. And while the content was interesting, what left the biggest impression on me was how lightweight his website was. I tinkered a bit and realized that he was not using Wordpress or Blogger (he uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a>), which are rather heavy (and ugly). I realized that I too wanted my own blog. Being the programmer that I am, I started creating my own blog-generating website called, well, <a href="https://github.com/agrawal-d/blog">blog</a>. But I quickly realized the problem - it needed dynamic hosting. And since Github Pages was the hosting I wanted to use, I had to search for another alternative.</p>

<h3 id="enter-jekyll">Enter Jekyll</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/logo-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll logo" /></p>

<p>Then a few days ago, I stumbled upon <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. And I immediately fell in love. Jkeyll was exactly what I was looking for. I no longer needed to reinvent the wheel. The project was very active, the documentation was beautiful and minmal themes were a-plenty! But the most important thing to me was that it was completely customizable! I like to tinker a lot with whatever I make, and Wordpress and Blogger are a bit difficult to handle for me. It took me less that 30 minutes to set up my own blog.</p>

<h3 id="a-quick-tutorial">A quick tutorial</h3>

<p>If you, like me, love the idea of using Jekyll ( which is written in Ruby, if you want to know ), then let me show you just <em>how</em> easy it is to use it. This is not an exhaustive introduction, and the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">official documentation</a> is the best place to get started. However, you will find the gist of what it is below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install ruby and ruby-dev.

If you are using a linux distribution, it should be very easy. Just use you package manager. For windows and mac, see the docs for detailed steps.

</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>ruby
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>ruby-dev
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>


</li>
<li>Install Jekyll and bundler gems

This should be sasy

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll bundler
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>


</li>
<li>Create a new blog in the folder <code>./blog</code>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>jekyll new myblog
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

</li>
<li> cd into the current directory and serve the site locally

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nb">cd </span>myblog
bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. Your static blog-site should be ready to publish. Open it in your browser. It should look something like this</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>Nothing is perfect. The downside of Jekyll is the same as it’s upside - its a stactic website generator. You cand have dynamically generated content like comments, dashboards, user-generated content or submissions or customized content for different users. But I think that its for the better that these features are not included. I prefer simple, clean, fast websites. Jekyll was never meant for dynamic content.</p>

<p>But I still think that comments are important for a blog. It’s great to hear what users think of your posts and they usually have something to add to it. There are solutions like Github events or Disqus, but I dont like either of them. Github events seems just wrong, and I Disqus has ads and privacy concerns. I am thinking of hosting an actual Node.JS server and fetching comments via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>. I will create another post when I finally implement that. Until then, to send your thoughts to, visit <a href="/contact">this page</a>.</p>
