<p>Hi! My name is Divyanshu Agrawal. I am a programmer, and I enjoy making cool stuff with code, such as this blog! I am currently in my second year of study of computer science at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/">BITS Pilani (Hyderabad Campus)</a>. The course I have enjoyed the most ( till now ) <a href="documents/CS_F222_A4.pdf">CS F222 Discrete Structures for Computer Science</a>, I keep tinkering with various projects, most of which you cand find at my github homepage <a href="https://github.com/ahrawal-d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I enjoy reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26803636">books</a>. My favourite genre is Fantasy. Some my favourite books are <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee, <strong>Eragon</strong> by Christopher Paolini and <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong> by Jack London. I also enjoy drawing occasionally.</p>

<p>I like to read a lot about computer science, culture, technology, and philosophy. As a consequence, my favourite websites are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/">JSTOR Daily</a>. I love to read detailed articles about anything at all, so if you find something interesting on the internet, please do <a href="/contact">share it with me</a>.</p>

<p>You can get in touch with me <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>
